The only problem is that you do not know where to go.

there are two paths available to you. North where

Cemetery Grounds

The cemetery was shrouded in an eerie darkness,
with only the faint light of the moon casting
shadows on the gravestones.The wind whistled through the trees,
rustling the leaves and adding an ominous atmosphere to the already
spooky surroundings. You can only head back south
Due to the tall barbed fence surrounding the premises.

Elegant Front Door

The grand front door is a masterpiece of design,
with intricate carvings and a rich, mahogany finish.
Its graceful arch and polished brass hardware make a stunning
first impression, welcoming visitors into the beautifully
appointed home beyond. You note that you can go east
towards a great smell, west back to the
main entrance, or south.

Kitchen

A bustling and aromatic room filled with open fires,
bubbling cauldrons, and busy cooks preparing hearty meals for lords,
ladies, and peasants alike. You see your options of travel are either
south toward an oddly placed carpet, west toward the beautiful front door,
or east toward the sharp sent of gasoline.

Garage

As you push open the door to the garage, the musty smell of oil and
gasoline wafts over you, and you are greeted by the sight of a stylish car,
workbench, and various tools scattered about. You can see from this room you can
go north to the front door, or west toward the sound of roaring flames and bubbling
liquid.

Secret Floor Board Passage

As you lift the corner of the carpet,
you discover a slightly raised spot and upon pulling it back,
you reveal a small trapdoor in the floorboards leading to a hidden passageway.
You note you can head south toward a stench that is unbearable, or north to the
kitchen.

Monsters Lair

As you cautiously step into the forest monster's lair, the stench of
rotting flesh and decay assaults your senses. The darkness envelops you,
and you can feel the monster's presence looming
over you as you tread further into the unknown. From this place you
can run either north back toward where you've come from, or
east deeper into the forest

Forest Escape

You sprint through the dense foliage,
dodging branches and leaping over fallen logs as you hear the sound of
footsteps closing in behind you.
The cool air fills your lungs as you burst out of the trees,
your heart racing with the thrill of escape. You've beat the game press q or quit to win.
